 STEPS TO RUN

Unreal Version: 5.0.3
WWise Version:2021.1.10.7883


1.Clone Project From Github
2.Right Click On UProject & Generate Visual Studio Files
3. Intergrate WWise into the project using the WWise launcher
4. Open Visual Studio and Press F5 if the project still won't open and tells you you to rebuild from source manually
5. If sounds are missing in-game, regenerate sound banks within Unreal. This seems to be an occasional bug within the Unreal-WWise integration plugin.

CONTROLS

P Or Escape To Open Up Menu That Allows You to change audio levels and mess with mechanic's car RTPC.
